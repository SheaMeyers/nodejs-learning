## Running MongoDB

MongoDB is required for running both the server and the tests

From user directory run

```
mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/shea/mongodb-data
```

## Running Server

```
npm run dev
```

Note: This project only acts as an API.  It does not have a front-end meaning it's not really usable through a web browser.  To test or use this you can use Postman or build a custom frontend for this.

## Running Tests

```
npm run test
```
